# How do I add this?

1. Drag the `cardgenerator.py` folder to `ballsdex/packages/balls`

It should look like this:

2. Open `cog.py` in the same folder and import the following:
- from ballsdex.packages.balls.cardgenerator import CardGenerator
- import io
- from ballsdex.core.utils.transformers import BallTransform
- from ballsdex.core.utils.transformers import SpecialTransform

3. Open `command.py` and copy it's contents.

4. Add the command like normal. If you need a reminder on how to add them or don't know how, click [here](https://github.com/ContestedWheel/EvalEvalEval-BD/wiki/Adding-custom-commands#adding-a-command)

4.1. Optionally, uncomment the 4th app_commands if you want the command to be an admin command.

5. Save the file, and restart the bot using `docker compose restart`. Refresh your Discord if you don't see the command.
