> This repo is no longer being maintained actively. I will still do some fixes when reported but I most likely won't add anymore custom commands or evals due to the repetitive process of trying to get licenses. If I do end up adding any, it will be from people that I know have given me full permission to add their work here.

This is a repo for custom commands and evals that various people in the community have made for Ballsdex.

As Custom Commands are a little bit more on the advanced side, I have created some tutorials that will try to help beginners. Click "Wiki" or [click this blue text.](https://github.com/ContestedWheel/EvalEvalEval-BD/wiki) to access them.

Custom Commands are **NOT** packages. Please stop treating them like one.

If you don't want to touch code or not ready for adding custom stuff yet, I suggest you steer away from the Custom Commands part until you are ready.

If you have any custom commands or evals you want me to add, ping me in the Ballsdex Developers discord server (ihailthenight1234).

## FAQ

### Q: What happened to all of the custom commands? There were so many!

I unfourtnately had to delete almost all of them due to licensing issues. I did not have a license on the custom commands and the ones with licenses are not common, so I made the hard decision to delete many custom commands and keep the ones that have licenses.

### Q: Where are all the evals?

I also had to delete them due to them also not having a license, therefore I cannot really host any evals on this repo. If anyone wants to give permissions to me to use their evals, please let me know.

### Q: So, what happens now?

I am trying to get licenses for as much custom commands and evals as I can but not all of them will come back. The wiki with all the tutorials I have made will still be up.
